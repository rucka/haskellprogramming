Given the following lines of code they might appear in a source file, how would you change them to use them directly in the REPL?
. 1) `half x = x / 2` -> `let half x = x / 2`
. 2) `square x = x * x` `let square x = x * x`

Write one function that can accept one argument and work for all the following expressions. Be sure to name the functions
. - `3.14 * (5 * 5)`
. - `3.14 * (10 * 10)`
. - `3.14 * (2 * 2)`
. - `3.14 * (4 * 4)`

`dpi x = 3.14 * x * x`
`dpi x = pi * x * x`
