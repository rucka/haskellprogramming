== 3 Strings
=== 3.4 Top-level versus local definitions
==== Exercises: Scope

.1 These lines of code are from a REPL session. Is `y` in scope for `z`? --> yes

[source]
-----
Prelude> let x = 5
Prelude> let y = 7
Prelude> let z = x * y
-----

.2 These lines of code are from a REPL session. Is `h` in scope for `g`? Go with your gut here --> no

[source]
-----
Prelude> let f = 3
Prelude> let g = 6 * f + h
-----

.3 These lines of code are from a REPL session. Is everything we need to execute area in scope --> no

[source]
-----
area d = pi * (r * r)
r = d / 2
-----

.4 These lines of code are from a REPL session. Now are `r` and `d` in scope for `area` --> ok

[source]
-----
area d = pi * (r * r)
  where r = d / 2
-----

=== 3.5 Types of concatenation functions
==== Exercises: Syntax Errors

Read the syntax of the following functions and decide whether it will compile. Test them in your REPL and try to fix the syntax errors where they occur.

.1 ++ [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6] --> concat [[1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]]
.2 '<3' ++ ' Haskell'  --> "<3" ++ " Haskell"
.3 concat ["<3", " Haskell"] --> ok
